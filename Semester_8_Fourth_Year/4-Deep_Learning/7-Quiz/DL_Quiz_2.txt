text generation

1 - D II is True and I is False
2 - A
Model can represent Boolean function which are linearly separable
3 - A Loss Function
Loss Functions are used to calculate the error between the known predicted output and the actual output generated by a model, Also often called Cost Functions
4 - A True (Convex Func one minima)
5 -  RBM Defn
Contrastive Divergence
The Boltzmann machine uses a technique called contrastive divergence to update the weights. 
6 - D
Bias Shift 
7 - Gibbs Sampling

8 - A
The encoder takes the input data and maps it to a compressed representation (also known as the bottleneck or latent space), while the decoder takes the compressed representation and maps it back to the original input data.
